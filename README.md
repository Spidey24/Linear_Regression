# Linear_Regression
A Linear Regression Model using Python on Housing Price Prediciton

Problem Statement:

The data (Raw_Housing_Prices.csv) contains the selling prices of different houses based on different characteristics/attributes like area, no. of rooms, no. of bathrooms, etc.
At times, the property dealers appreciate the prices based on the demand and hence there is rise in prices in real estate. So, in order to cope with this problem so that it is beneficial for the customers, build a model in place which should tell us the ideal prices of the house based on its characteristics.
